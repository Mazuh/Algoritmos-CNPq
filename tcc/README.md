# Conclusion Report
## Maintained for historical reasons.

Some of the source code produced and stored in [../src/](../src/) directory was made
during my High School for participating as an intern researcher at 
[National Council of Cientific and Technological Development (CNPq)](http://cnpq.br/).
My job was to promote a Diffusion of Knowledge in High School, helping to maintain a project
called "Training of Students in High School for Programming Competitions", coordinated at
[IFRN](http://portal.ifrn.edu.br/) by teacher [Bruno Sielly Jales da Costa](http://lattes.cnpq.br/2486327435960311)
(doctored, member of IEEE societies about [Computational Intelligence](http://cis.ieee.org/) and [Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society](http://www.ieeesmc.org/), IA researcher at [Ford](https://www.ford.com.br/)).

This [report](./TCC.pdf) was my final work that earned me an IT Technician Degree,
after the approval of an examining board in 2016/03/23 and right before I've gone to college.
